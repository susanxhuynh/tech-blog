## What Works for Women at Work, Joan C. Williams
General career advice is helpful, to a point. This book talks about how
women are perceived at work, and strategies for women to navigate and
succeed. TLDR, (most) women, especially women of color, have to walk a
tightrope to advance in the workplace, contrary to general career advice
that only works for men.

Highly recommended - this book completely changed by understanding of how
to succeed at work in tech.
